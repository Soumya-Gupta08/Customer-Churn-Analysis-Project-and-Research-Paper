# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Project & Research Paper

This repository contains a **Customer Churn Prediction** project focused on identifying factors that contribute to customer attrition in a business and predicting whether a customer is likely to churn. The project involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building**, and interpretation of results.
